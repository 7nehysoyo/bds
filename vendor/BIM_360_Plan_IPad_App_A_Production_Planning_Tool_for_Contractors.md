You can also add notes, attachments, and photos to document the progress and issues of each activity.
 
BIM 360 Plan iPad app also helps you collaborate with your project team and stakeholders. You can sync your work plan with the BIM 360 Plan web service, which stores your data in the cloud and allows you to access it from any device.

BIM 360 Plan iPad app also helps you analyze and improve your production planning performance. You can use the app to track the percentage of planned activities that are completed on time (PPC), which is a key indicator of reliability and efficiency. You can also use the app to identify the root causes of any deviations from the plan, such as design changes, material shortages, weather delays, etc. You can then use this information to implement corrective actions and prevent future problems.
